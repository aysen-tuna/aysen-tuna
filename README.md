## Hi, I’m Aysen Tuna 👋

👨‍💻 Software Developer | 🚀 Passionate about building user-centric web apps | 🌱 Lifelong Learner

I focus on building modern web applications with a strong emphasis on clean user experience, structure, and reliability.

I enjoy working across the entire stack and am continuously deepening my frontend and backend architecture skills by developing end-to-end systems — from responsive UI to APIs, authentication, databases, and payment integrations.

As a Computer Engineering graduate, my earlier technical training supports my analytical and structured approach to development and helps me build more reliable, scalable solutions through real-world projects.

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TailwindCSS.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, REST APIs.
- **Database & Auth**: Firebase (Firestore).
- **DevOps**: GitHub Actions.
